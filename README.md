## Projects

Electronic Sports Data Analysis and Visualization
- My Electronic Sports Data Analysis and Visualization project delved into the realm of professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) matches, focusing on the popularity of maps among the top 30 teams. Leveraging a comprehensive CS:GO dataset containing match details, team compositions, and map pick/ban sequences, I aimed to answer the question: "What are the most popular and least popular maps in CSGO?" Through exploratory data analysis, I unveiled intriguing insights into map preferences among the competitive gaming community. Notably, the project shed light on how factors like map additions and removals over time influenced map pick rates. By presenting compelling visualizations and actionable findings, this project showcases my ability to extract valuable insights from complex esports data.

Electronic Sports Score Prediction
- In my Electronic Sports Score Prediction project, I harnessed professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) match data spanning several years to explore the extent to which rank differences could predict match outcomes, accounting for map and starting side variables. Despite the project's outcome not aligning with the original prediction, the experience was invaluable. This endeavor highlighted the intricate challenges of applying machine learning to sports score prediction, revealing the limitations in quantifying unmeasurable factors that significantly influence match results. By showcasing the complexities and shortcomings of such predictions, this project underscored the importance of considering human and contextual nuances in machine learning applications.
