**Electronic Sports Data Analysis and Visualization**
- My Electronic Sports Data Analysis and Visualization project delved into the realm of professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) matches, focusing on the popularity of maps among the top 30 teams using a Streamlit web app. Leveraging a comprehensive CS:GO dataset containing match details, team compositions, and map pick/ban sequences, I aimed to answer the question: "What are the most popular and least popular maps in CSGO?" Through exploratory data analysis, I unveiled intriguing insights into map preferences among the competitive gaming community. Notably, the project shed light on how map additions and removals influenced map pick rates over time. This project showcases my ability to extract valuable insights from complex esports data by presenting compelling visualizations and actionable findings.
- One of the project's main challenges was effectively conveying the insights derived from the analysis. I had to explore various methods to ensure that the findings were presented in a way that allowed for easy comprehension and knowledge extraction. Reflecting on the project, I acknowledge that I could have further improved it by incorporating normalization techniques into my visualizations. Nevertheless, despite these challenges and areas for improvement, the project remains a valuable source of learning and actionable insights.
- Leveraged **Streamlit** to develop an interactive web app for data exploration and analysis, showcasing proficiency in creating user-friendly interfaces. Employed data transformation techniques with **Altair** and **Pandas** to preprocess and clean data. Crafted **interactive visualizations** with features like tooltips, selection, and filtering. Enabled users to select datasets through a dropdown menu for dynamic exploration. Employed bar charts to illustrate map popularity and implemented time series analysis for tracking map selection trends. Utilized label dictionaries for data labeling, enhancing visual clarity. Employed effective data storytelling through text elements (subheaders, introduction, conclusion) to narrate compelling insights. Acknowledged and learned from project challenges, including the desire to incorporate normalization techniques. Proficiently employed essential tools and technologies such as Streamlit, Altair, Pandas, and others to deliver a comprehensive and informative data analysis and visualization project.
- Looking back on it, I wish I had incorporated the normalization more into my visualizations. Regardless, there is still a lot to learn from them.

**Electronic Sports Score Prediction**
- In my Electronic Sports Score Prediction project, I harnessed professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) match data spanning several years to explore the extent to which rank differences could predict match outcomes, accounting for map and starting side variables. Despite the project's outcome not aligning with the original prediction, the experience was invaluable. This endeavor highlighted the intricate challenges of applying machine learning to sports score prediction, revealing the limitations in quantifying unmeasurable factors that significantly influence match results. By showcasing the complexities and shortcomings of such predictions, this project underscored the importance of considering human and contextual nuances in machine learning applications.
