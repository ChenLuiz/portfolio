**Electronic Sports Data Analysis and Visualization**  
For this project, I dug into professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) matches, specifically looking at map popularity among the top 30 teams. Using a hefty CS:GO dataset, I set out to figure out which maps were hot and which ones were not in the world of CSGO. Along the way, I uncovered some interesting trends about which maps players preferred and how changes to the map pool affected their choices.

It wasn't all smooth sailing, though. I had my fair share of challenges, especially when it came to making sense of all the data and presenting my findings in a clear way. Looking back, I realize there's room for improvement, like finding better ways to visualize the data for easier understanding. But hey, that's all part of the learning process, right?

On the technical side, I built an interactive web app using Streamlit to let users explore the data themselves. With tools like Altair and Pandas, I cleaned up the data and crafted some cool visualizations to help tell the story. From bar charts to time series analysis, I made sure the insights were easy to grasp and engaging to interact with.

Reflecting on the project, I see areas where I could've done better, like improving the clarity of my visualizations. But overall, it's a testament to my ability to dive into complex data and come out with meaningful insights, all while keeping things user-friendly and engaging.

**Electronic Sports Score Prediction**
- In my Electronic Sports Score Prediction project, I harnessed professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) match data spanning several years to explore the extent to which rank differences could predict match outcomes, accounting for map and starting side variables. Despite the project's outcome not aligning with the original prediction, the experience was invaluable. This endeavor highlighted the intricate challenges of applying machine learning to sports score prediction, revealing the limitations in quantifying unmeasurable factors that significantly influence match results. By showcasing the complexities and shortcomings of such predictions, this project underscored the importance of considering human and contextual nuances in machine learning applications.
