## About Me
Hello! I'm Luiz Chen, a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Data Science and a minor in Business Analytics from Champlain College. My academic journey provided me with a solid foundation in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. My studies have also given me a solid understanding of business principles and strategies. One of my main career goals is to become a leading data scientist who excels technically and contributes to strategic decision-making within an organization. I aim to work on projects that drive innovation and efficiency, making a significant impact on business outcomes.

## Projects
**Vermont Lake Monsters Business Data Analysis** ([View in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oq9r6YTVKxWudT-YAbd7TB-pR8CQk_tw?usp=sharing))
For this project, I dove into Vermont Lake Monsters' concessions sales data from various files, merging them into a unified dataset for comprehensive analysis. My aim was to pinpoint the top-selling items and see how much net income was generated from them while identifying low-performing items to guide strategic decision-making.

I encountered difficulties in data cleaning and presentation, but these obstacles sharpened my skills in identifying revenue center performance, highlighting the highest and lowest-performing areas to drive targeted optimization efforts.

I also explored seasonal patterns within the data, leveraging these insights to adapt operational strategies despite the limited historical data available. Additionally, I utilized geocoding techniques to geographically analyze ticket sales data, uncovering key geographical trends and customer distribution patterns.

Reflecting on the project, I see opportunities for improvement, particularly in enhancing the clarity of my data visualizations. Nevertheless, the experience underscored my ability to dive into complex data and extract meaningful insights, all while focusing on user-friendly and engaging presentations.

**Electronic Sports Data Analysis and Visualization** ([Access Link](https://chenluiz-data-visualizations.streamlit.app/))

For this project, I dug into professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) matches, specifically looking at map popularity among the top 30 teams. Using a hefty CS:GO dataset, I set out to figure out which maps were hot and which ones were not in the world of CSGO. Along the way, I uncovered some interesting trends about which maps players preferred and how changes to the map pool affected their choices.

It wasn't all smooth sailing, though. I had my fair share of challenges, especially when it came to making sense of all the data and presenting my findings in a clear way. Looking back, I realize there's room for improvement, like finding better ways to visualize the data for easier understanding.

On the technical side, I built an interactive web app using Streamlit to let users explore the data themselves. With tools like Altair and Pandas, I cleaned up the data and crafted some cool visualizations to help tell the story. From bar charts to time series analysis, I made sure the insights were easy to grasp and engaging to interact with.

Reflecting on the project, I see areas where I could've done better, like improving the clarity of my visualizations. But overall, it's a testament to my ability to dive into complex data and come out with meaningful insights, all while keeping things user-friendly and engaging.

**Electronic Sports Score Prediction**     
In my Electronic Sports Score Prediction project, I harnessed professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) match data spanning several years to explore the extent to which rank differences could predict match outcomes, accounting for map and starting side variables. Despite the project's outcome not aligning with the original prediction, the experience was invaluable. This endeavor highlighted the intricate challenges of applying machine learning to sports score prediction, revealing the limitations in quantifying unmeasurable factors that significantly influence match results. By showcasing the complexities and shortcomings of such predictions, this project underscored the importance of considering human and contextual nuances in machine learning applications.
