# Hi there, I'm Luiz Chen!

## About Me
I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Data Science and a minor in Business Analytics from Champlain College. My academic journey gave me a solid foundation in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. My studies have also given me a solid understanding of business principles and strategies. One of my main career goals is to become a leading data scientist who excels technically and contributes to strategic decision-making within an organization. I aim to work on projects that drive innovation and efficiency, significantly impacting business outcomes.

## Projects
**Vermont Lake Monsters Concessions Data Analysis** ([Github](https://github.com/ChenLuiz/concessions_data_analysis)|[Code](https://github.com/ChenLuiz/concessions_data_analysis/blob/main/lake_monsters.ipynb))      
This project involves a detailed analysis of the Vermont Lake Monsters' concessions sales data. The objective is to uncover patterns, identify trends, and provide actionable insights that can help improve sales strategies. The project shows my ability to handle real-world data and apply analytical techniques to derive meaningful conclusions.

**Basic spam filter project** ([Github](https://github.com/ChenLuiz/basic_spam_filter)|[Code](https://github.com/ChenLuiz/basic_spam_filter/blob/main/spam_filter.ipynb))      
This project is a basic spam filter designed to practice and apply concepts I've learned throughout my college experience. The project features two different filters: one utilizing the built-in CountVectorizer method and another that implements an alternative approach. This hands-on project demonstrates my understanding of text processing and classification techniques in a simple yet effective way.


**Electronic Sports Data Analysis and Visualization** ([Access Link](https://chenluiz-data-visualizations.streamlit.app/))

For this project, I dug into professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) matches, specifically looking at map popularity among the top 30 teams. Using a hefty CS:GO dataset, I set out to figure out which maps were hot and which ones were not in the world of CSGO. Along the way, I uncovered some interesting trends about which maps players preferred and how changes to the map pool affected their choices.

It wasn't all smooth sailing, though. I had my fair share of challenges, especially when it came to making sense of all the data and presenting my findings. Looking back, I realize there's room for improvement, like finding better ways to visualize the data for easier understanding.

On the technical side, I built an interactive web app using Streamlit to let users explore the data themselves. With tools like Altair and Pandas, I cleaned up the data and crafted some cool visualizations to help tell the story. From bar charts to time series analysis, I made sure the insights were easy to grasp and engaging to interact with.

Reflecting on the project, I see areas where I could've done better, like improving the clarity of my visualizations. But overall, it's a testament to my ability to dive into complex data and come out with meaningful insights, all while keeping things user-friendly and engaging.

**Electronic Sports Score Prediction**     
In my Electronic Sports Score Prediction project, I used professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) match data from several years to see how well rank differences could predict match outcomes, considering variables like the map and starting side. Although the results didn't match the initial predictions, the project was incredibly insightful. I believe that this project could have been improved if I had more data available to me. It highlighted the challenges of using machine learning for sports score predictions, especially when trying to account for unmeasurable factors that impact match results. This project showed me the importance of considering human and contextual elements in machine learning, and it highlighted the difficulties of making accurate predictions when there are so many variables.
